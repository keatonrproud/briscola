### TODO List
- Sockets
  - [ ] Room count is accurate at all times and accounts for disconnects
  - [ ] Multiple rooms available, or implement logic for random selection within the room
  - [ ] Create method for removing players from the game + room (used for disconnects, exit game button, end of game, etc)
    - Remove them from the existing room
    - Return to the home page as default, or to `end_game` for a disconnect

- In-Game
  - Logic
  - [ ] Make sure `end_game` works as expected
  - [ ] Exit game button that returns home
  - [ ] Handle disconnect functionality for online multiplayer
    - Attempt to reconnect with a warning popup, after ~X sec then end game + disconnect
  - Appearance
    - [ ] Logic for offline use to load images locally
      - doesn't work offline?
    - [ ] Wait for cards, etc to load before showing objects on game screen
    - [ ] Fix card image alignment

    - [ ] Friendly for small screens, ie mobile
    - [ ] Choice of card set (Piacentine, etc)
    - [ ] Confetti only for the winning player in online multiplayer

- Site Improvements
  - [ ] Small link to the repo on the home screen
  - [ ] Workaround for Render's free tier timeout of ~15min inactivity
  - [ ] If user is not in a game, via USER_LOCAL_GAME or USER_ROOM, then return them home from /turn or /end_game
    - Remove users from their room after being removed from a game
    - Need to convert `/turn` and `/end_game` into `socketio.on()` to access `request.sid`
  - [ ] Signed URL for S3 bucket
